## Explaination

We made this platform for the course: Project 1.

It is a platform where people can book a table at any restaurant they want.
The can pick the table, number of people, the time, the date.
They can leave a comment and give a score on the restaurant.

It was one of our first projects in PHP, but it was made by the OOP principal.
