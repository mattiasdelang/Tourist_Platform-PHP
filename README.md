# Tourist platform
## Explanation

I made this platform for the course: Project 2.

The project was based around tourism, you were free to choose what you would make, but it had to do with tourism.

I choose for a platform for schools, specificaly schools who are doing trips to other countries with their students.

The platform is basicly a route planner. You can choose what u visit and in what order, also u can link a visit place to a student: this gives the possibility to let student make a task around their linked visit place.
